# phonebook
A simple Swing-backed phonebook.

The basic functionality:

1. Adding a new phone record.
2. Searching the phone records, either by a first letter or by a substring.
3. Removing any of the existing phone records. (If there are more than one record, the user needs to type correctly the phone number to remove the correct record.)

Use actively Enter key, when focus is on the fields or the buttons, as Add and Find actions can be triggered in such a way conveniently.
