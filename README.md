# phonebook
A simple Swing-backed phonebook.

To compile and run, type in the command line from within the directory containing all 3 source files:

unix % javac PhoneBook.java

unix % java PhoneBook

The basic functionality:

1. Adding a new phone record.
2. Searching the phone records, either by a first letter or by a substring.
3. Removing any of the existing phone records. (If there are more than one record, the user needs to type correctly the phone number to remove the correct record.)

Use actively Enter key, when focus is on the fields or the buttons, as Add and Find actions can be triggered in such a way conveniently.
